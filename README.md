# DTEesque


This program simulates the basic working of DTE (Directorate of Technical Education,Maharashtra) functioning, the way  engineering colleges are allocated to students according to marks obtained by students & cutoffs generated by the demand of any particular college. 
    The inputs required are number of students in the system , names & marks of those students & any 3(which can be modified) choices of colleges which are stored in a structure. The output is the student name with corresponding college allocated.  This is basically a pretty low level simulation of entire system.
    The logic of this system is to generate a merit list of students involved in the system according the marks they obtained in a particular entrance test. Now, according to their choices of college appropriate college spot is allocated taking care of possible clash of the spots. Only one student can get the spot, one with more marks is preferred. This is very low level building block of system.
